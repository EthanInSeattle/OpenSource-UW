# OpenSource-UW
These are the source codes for the webpages of the club, "OpenSource-UW". 

### How to update your webpage without pressing F5
When you develop your webpage, you may press F5 to check the result of your code. You don't have to do it anymore. I introducue to you this wonderful kit, Live Server. This little command-line tool will auto-reload your browser whenever your source files change. This is insanely handy when doing client-side development, and will save you a ton of time. It requires Node.js to run, and you can install it using npm, which comes with Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/). Run npm install -g live-server at the command line. If you are on a Mac and this command reports an error about not having permission, use sudo npm install -g live-server instead.
